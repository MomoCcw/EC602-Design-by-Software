% Midterm Two C++  
% EC602 Design by Software
% Fall 2020

Exam Outline
------------

You are asked to solve two problems in C++: 
vistance (a function) and SumParser (a class).

These are both described in more detail in the 
included program `midtermtwo_template.cpp`

Also included in the zip file provided is an example
input / output sequence for a working program program.
These are called example_input.txt and 
example_output.txt, and are generated using

```
mt2_solution <example_input.txt  >example_output.txt 
```
```

Note that the return code for the provided main
will be 4.


You must submit one C++ program with both the function
and the class defined. Your main() function should also
be functional, although I will not grade this part.

Grading
-------

Each problem is worth 50% of the test and your solutions
will be evaluated based on

- compilability (your programs must compile)
- correctness
- program style and general readability
- algorithm and data structure choices

Correctness is the most important criterion.
