# Grade Selection

In the template file (to be distributed at the start of the exam), you will
see a dictionary defining the point values for each component of the exam,
like this:

```
grade = {'a': 10,
         'b': 10,
         'c': 10,
         'd': 10,
         'e': 10,
         'f': 20,
         'g': 20,
         'h': 10}
```

You may make up to 10 points of adjustment to this dictionary. That is, you can
add 10 points and also subtract 10 points.

Here is an example "adjusted" grading scheme:

```
grade = {'a': 15,
         'b': 15,
         'c': 10,
         'd': 0,
         'e': 10,
         'f': 20,
         'g': 20,
         'h': 10}
```

The `a` and `b` components each had 5 points added, and the `d` component had 10 points 
subtracted.
